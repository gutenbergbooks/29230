<h3>(1784-1858)</h3>


<p>In a letter written to William Dunlap, from Philadelphia, on
June 10, 1832, James Nelson Barker very na&iuml;vely and very fully
outlined his career, inasmuch as he had been informed by
Manager Wood that Mr. Dunlap wished such an account for his
"History of the American Stage."</p>

<p>From this account, we learn that whatever dramatic ability
Mr. Barker possessed came from the enthusiasm created within
him as a reader of wide range. For example, in 1804, he became
the author of a one-act piece, entitled "Spanish Rover," furnished
in plot by Cervantes. In 1805, he wrote what he describes
as a Masque, entitled "America," in which poetic dialogue
afforded America, Science and Liberty the opportunity of singing
in unison. He confesses that this Masque was "to close a drama
I had projected on the adventures of Smith in Virginia, in the
olden time." Then followed a tragedy suggested by Gibbon,
entitled "Attila," but Mr. Barker had advanced only two acts
when news came to him that John Augustus Stone was at work
on a play of the same kind.</p>

<p>In his letter to Dunlap, Mr. Barker deplored this coincidence,
which put a stop to "Attila." "But have you never yourself
been the victim of these odd coincidences, and, just as you had
fixed upon a subject or a title, found yourself superseded&mdash;a
thing next in atrocity to the ancients' stealing all one's fine
thoughts. My comedy of 'Tears and Smiles' was to be called
'Name it Yourself,' when out comes a 'Name it Yourself,' in
England, and out comes too a 'Smiles and Tears,' with a widow,
an Irishman, and almost all my <i>dramat. pers.</i> I wrote the 'Indian
Princess,' and an 'Indian Princess' appears in England. Looking
over the old English dramatists, I am struck with the 'Damon
and Pythias' of Edwards as a subject, but am scarcely set down
to it, when lo, the modern play in London; and what is worse,
with the fine part of Pythias absolutely transformed into a
snivelling fellow, who bellows like a calf at the prospect of dying
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[Pg 568]</a></span>for his friend. 'Wallace' was purloined from me in like manner,
and several other heroes: at length I fix upon 'Epaminondas', as
a 'learned Theban' of so philosophical a cast of character, that
even the French had not thought of him for the boards. I form
my plot, and begin <i>con amore</i>, when I am told that Dr. Bird has
written a 'Pelopidas' and an 'Epaminondas,' comprehending the
whole life of the latter."</p>

<p>Then, having finished with his diatribe against coincidence&mdash;a
diatribe which excellently well shows the channels in which
Barker's literary mind ran, and likewise the closeness with which
he followed the literary activity of the period among his associates,
he continued in his narrative to Dunlap:</p>

<p>"'Tears and Smiles' was written between May 1 and June
12, of 1806, with the character of a Yankee intended for Jefferson.
By the way, such a Yankee as I drew!" he writes. "I wonder
what Hackett would say to it! The truth is, I had never even
seen a Yankee at the time."</p>

<p>Then, in view of Barker's political tastes which, in consideration
of the dramatists of those days, one must always take into
account, he wrote a piece called "The Embargo; or, What
News?" borrowed from Murphy's "Upholsterer," and produced
on March 16, 1808.</p>

<p>Between this play and 1809, "The Indian Princess" was
written, and what Barker has to say about it will be quoted in
its proper place.</p>

<p>Right now, we are letting him enumerate his own literary
activities, which were many and continuous.</p>

<p>In 1809, he Americanized Cherry's "Travellers," a dramatic
method which has long been in vogue between America and
England, and has, in many respects, spoiled many American
comedies for English consumption.</p>

<p>In 1812, at the request of Manager Wood, Mr. Barker made a
dramatization of Scott's "Marmion," and, strange to say, it was
announced as being written by Thomas Morton, Esq.</p>

<p>"This was audacious enough in all conscience," says Mr.
Barker, "but the finesse was successful, and a play most probably
otherwise destined to neglect, ran like wild fire through all our
theatres." On March 24, 1817, there was acted in Philadelphia,
Barker's "The Armourer's Escape; or, Three Years at Nootka
Sound," described by Mr. Barker as a melodramatic sketch,
founded on the adventures of John Jewett, the armourer of the
ship <i>Boston</i>, in which Jewett himself assumed the hero's r&ocirc;le.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[Pg 569]</a></span>
This same year he likewise wrote "How to Try a Lover," suggested
by Le Brun's novel. Finally, in 1824, on March 12, there
was performed "Superstition," a five-act drama. This closed
the account that Barker sent to Dunlap.</p>

<p>We see from it a number of things relative to placing Barker
as a literary personage. First, his interest in literature made
him draw from all sources, combining Scott with Holinshed,
and turning, as was the wont of the cultivated American of that
day, to the romantic literatures of the past. Secondly, Barker's
interest in Colonial History was manifest by his return, time and
time again, to Colonial records for dramatic material. Furthermore,
as a participant in the political disputes of his day, it
would have been a surprise had Barker not directed his pen to
some reflection of the discussions of the period.</p>

<p>James Nelson Barker was the son of the Honourable John
Barker, one-time Mayor of Philadelphia, and ex-Revolutionary
soldier. He was born in that city on June 17, 1784.</p>

<p>His education was received in Philadelphia, and he must have
entered the literary and political arenas at an early age. After
the fashion of the day, he was trained in the old-time courtesy
and in the old-time manner of defending one's honour with the
sword, for it is recorded that he was once severely wounded in
a duel.</p>

<p>At the outbreak of the War of 1812, he received a commission,
fighting mostly on the Canadian frontier, and winning distinction
as a Captain of Artillery. After the close of the War, he was
supported by the Democratic Party, and elected Mayor of the
City of Philadelphia. Later, he upheld "Old Hickory" for the
Presidency, and, after filling the position of the Collector of the
Port of Philadelphia from 1829-1838, on the election of Van
Buren to the presidency, he was appointed First Controller of
the Treasury, and moved to Washington. From that time on,
he was connected with the highest offices in the department.
His pen was continually dedicated to the support of Democracy,
and, during the years from 1832-1836, he figured as a contributor
to many papers of the time on political topics. He lived until
March 9, 1858.</p>

<p>I have selected his play, "The Indian Princess,"<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> as an example<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[Pg 570]</a></span>
of the numberless dramas that grew up around the character of
Pocahontas. The reader will find it particularly of interest to
contrast with this piece G. W. P. Custis's "Pocahontas; or, The
Settlers of Virginia" (1830), and John Brougham's burlesque,
"Po-ca-hon-tas; or, The Gentle Savage."</p>

<p>The Indian Drama, in America, is a subject well worth careful
attention. There are numberless plays mentioned by Laurence
Hutton in his "Curiosities of the American Stage" which, though
interesting as titles, have not been located as far as manuscripts
are concerned.</p>

<p>Barker's "The Indian Princess" is one of the earliest that deal
with the character of Pocahontas. The subject has been interestingly
treated in an article by Mr. E. J. Streubel (<i>The Colonnade</i>,
New York University, September, 1915).</p>

<p>Barker had originally intended his play, "The Indian Princess,"
to be a legitimate drama, instead of which, when it was first
produced, it formed the libretto for the music by a man named
John Bray, of the New Theatre. In his letter to Dunlap, he says:</p>

<p>"'The Indian Princess,' in three acts ... begun some time
before, was taken up in 1808, at the request of Bray, and worked
up into an opera, the music to which he composed. It was first
performed for his benefit on the 6th of April, 1808, to a crowded
house; but Webster, particularly obnoxious, at that period, to
a large party, having a part in it, a tremendous tumult took
place, and it was scarcely heard. I was on the stage, and directed
the curtain to be dropped. It has since been frequently acted in,
I believe, all the theatres of the United States. A few years
since, I observed, in an English magazine, a critique on a drama
called 'Pocahontas; or, the Indian Princess,' produced at Drury
Lane. From the sketch given, this piece differs essentially from
mine in the plan and arrangement; and yet, according to the
critic, they were indebted for this very stupid production 'to
America, where it is a great favourite, and is to be found in all
the printed collections of stock plays.' The copyright of the
'Indian Princess' was also given to Blake, and transferred to
Longworth. It was printed in 1808 or 1809. George Washington
Custis, of Arlington, has, I am told, written a drama on the same
subject."</p>

<p>An account of the riot is to be found in Durang's "History of
the Philadelphia Stage," and the reader, in order to gain some
knowledge of the popularity of "The Indian Princess," may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[Pg 571]</a></span>
likewise obtain interesting material in Manager Wood's "Diary,"
the manuscript of which is now in possession of the University
of Pennsylvania. When the play was given in Philadelphia, the
advertisement announced, "The principal materials forming this
dramatic trifle are extracted from the General History of Virginia,
written by Captain Smith, and printed London, folio, 1624; and
as close an adherence to historic truth has been preserved as
dramatic rules would allow of."</p>

<p>It was given its first New York production at the Park Theatre
on June 14, 1808.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[Pg 573]</a></span></p>

<h2 class="gap3"><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>While I am proud to acknowledge my grateful sense of those
flattering marks of liberal kindness with which my dramatic
entr&eacute;e has been greeted by an indulgent audience, I feel so fully
conscious of the very humble merit of this little piece, that perhaps
nothing but the peculiar circumstances under which it was
acted should have induced me to publish it. In sending it to
the press I am perfectly apprized of the probability that it goes
only to add one more to the list of those unfortunate children
of the American drama, who, in the brief space that lies between
their birth and death, are doomed to wander, without house or
home, unknown and unregarded, or who, if heeded at all, are
only picked up by some critic beadle to receive the usual treatment
of vagrants. Indeed, were I disposed to draw comfort
from the misfortunes of others, I might make myself happy
with the reflection, that however my vagabond might deserve
the lash, it would receive no more punishment than those who
deserved none at all; for the gentlemen castigators seldom take
the pains to distinguish Innocence from Guilt, but most liberally
bestow their stripes on all poor wanderers who are unhappily of
American parentage. Far, however, from rejoicing at this
circumstance, I sincerely deplore it. In all ages, and in every
country, even the sturdiest offspring of genius have felt the
necessity and received the aid of a protecting hand of favour to
support and guide their first trembling and devious footsteps;
it is not, therefore, wonderful, that here, where every art is yet
but in its infancy, the youthful exertions of dramatic poetry,
unaided and unsupported, should fail, and that its imbecile
efforts should for ever cease with the failure; that chilled by
total neglect, or chid with undeserved severity; depressed by
ridicule, starved by envy, and stricken to the earth by malevolence,
the poor orphan, heartless and spirit-broken, should pine
away a short and sickly life. I am not, I believe, quite coxcomb
enough to advance the most distant hint that the child of my
brain deserves a better fate; that it may meet with it I might,
however, be indulged in hoping, under the profession that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[Pg 576]</a></span>
hope proceeds from considerations distinct from either it or
myself. Dramatic genius, with genius of every other kind, is
assuredly native of our soil, and there wants but the wholesome
and kindly breath of favour to invigourate its delicate frame, and
bid it rapidly arise from its cradle to blooming maturity. But
alas! poor weak ones! what a climate are ye doomed to draw
your first breath in! the teeming press has scarcely ceased
groaning at your delivery, ere you are suffocated with the stagnant
atmosphere of entire apathy, or swept out of existence by
the hurricane of unsparing, indiscriminating censure!</p>

<p>Good reader, I begin to suspect that I have held you long
enough by the button. Yet, maugre my terror of being tiresome,
and in despite of my clear anticipation of the severe puns which
will be made in this punning city, on my <i>childish</i> preface, I must
push my allusion a little further, to deprecate the wrath of
the critics, and arouse the sympathies of the ladies. Then, O
ye sage censors! ye goody gossips at poetic births! I vehemently
importune ye to be convinced, that for my bantling I desire
neither rattle nor bells; neither the lullaby of praise, nor the
pap of patronage, nor the hobby-horse of honour. 'Tis a plain-palated,
home-bred, and I may add independent urchin, who
laughs at sugar plums, and from its little heart disdains gilded
gingerbread. If you like it&mdash;so; if not&mdash;why so; yet, without
being mischievous, it would fain be amusing; therefore, if its
gambols be pleasant, and your gravities permit, laugh; if not,
e'en turn aside your heads, and let the wanton youngling laugh
by itself. If it speak like a sensible child, prithee, pat its cheek,
and say so; but if it be ridiculous when it would be serious,
smile, and permit the foolish attempt to pass. But do not, O
goody critic, apply the birch, because its unpractised tongue
cannot lisp the language of Shakspeare, nor be very much
enraged, if you find it has to creep before it can possibly walk.</p>

<p>To your bosoms, ladies, sweet ladies! the little stranger flies
with confidence for protection; shield it, I pray you, from the
iron rod of rigour, and scold it yourselves, as much as you will,
for on <i>your</i> smooth and polished brows it can never read wrinkled
cruelty; the mild anger of <i>your</i> eyes will not blast it like the
fierce scowl of the critic; the chidings of <i>your</i> voice will be
soothing music to it, and it will discover the dimple of kindness
in your very frowns. Caresses it does not ask; its modesty
would shrink from that it thought it deserved not; but if its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[Pg 577]</a></span>
faults be infantile, its punishment should be gentle, and from
you, dear ladies, correction would be as thrillingly sweet as that
the little <i>Jean Jacques</i> received from the fair hand of
Mademoiselle Lambercier.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> It lies far beyond the wide water.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Prince.</span> Is there then a world beyond the wide water? I
thought only the sun had been there: thou comest then from
behind the sun?</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> Not so, prince.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Prince.</span> Listen to me. Thy country lies beyond the wide
water, and from it do mine eyes behold the sun rise each morning.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> Prince, to your sight he seems to rise from thence,
but your eyes are deceived, they reach not over the wilderness of
waters.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Prince.</span> Where sleeps the sun then?</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> The sun never sleeps. When you see him sink behind
the mountains, he goes to give light to other countries, where
darkness flies before him, as it does here, when you behold him
rise in the east: thus he chases Night for ever round the world.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Prince.</span> Tell me, wise stranger, how came you from your
country across the wide water? when our canoes venture but
a little from the shore, the waves never fail to swallow them up.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> Prince, the Great Spirit is the friend of the white men,
and they have arts which the red men know not.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Prince.</span> My brother, will you teach the red men?</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> I come to do it. My king is a king of a mighty nation;
he is great and good: go, said he, go and make the red men wise
and happy.</p>

entered a charming stream, that seemed to glide through a fairy
land of fertility. I must know more of this, said our captain.
Await my return here. So bidding us moor the pinnace in a
broad basin, where the Indian's arrows could reach us from
neither side, away he went, alone in his boat, to explore the river
to its head.</p>

Lucifer, and whiz came a cloud of arrows about our ears. Three
tall fellows of ours fell: Cassen, Emery, and Robinson. Our
lieutenant, with Percy and myself, fought our way to the water
side, where, leaving our canoe as a trophy to the victors, we

<p class="hangindent"><span class="smcap">Scene</span> I. <i>Inside the palace at Werocomoco. <span class="smcap">Powhatan</span> in state,

Music.</i></p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Powhatan.</span> My people, strange beings have appeared among
us; they come from the bosom of the waters, amid fire and
thunder; one of them has our war-god delivered into our hands:
behold the white being!</p>

<p class="hangindent"><i>Music. <span class="smcap">Smith</span> is brought in; his appearance excites universal
wonder; <span class="smcap">Pocahontas</span> expresses peculiar admiration.</i></p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Pocahontas.</span> O Nima! is it not a God!</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Powhatan.</span> Miami, though thy years are few, thou art experienced
as age; give us thy voice of counsel.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Miami.</span> Brothers, this stranger is of a fearful race of beings;
their barren hunting grounds lie beneath the world, and they
have risen, in monstrous canoes, through the great water, to
spoil and ravish from us our fruitful inheritance. Brothers, this
stranger must die; six of our brethren have fall'n by his hand.
Before we lay their bones in the narrow house, we must avenge
them: their unappeased spirits will not go to rest beyond the
mountains; they cry out for the stranger's blood.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Nantaquas.</span> Warriors, listen to my words; listen, my father,
while your son tells the deeds of the brave white man. I saw
him when 300 of our fiercest chiefs formed the warring around
him. But he defied their arms; he held lightning in his hand.
Wherever his arm fell, there sunk a warrior: as the tall tree falls,
blasted and riven, to the earth, when the angry Spirit darts his
fires through the forest. I thought him a God; my feet grew to
the ground; I could not move!</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Pocahontas.</span> Nima, dost thou hear the words of my brother.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Nantaquas.</span> The battle ceased, for courage left the bosom
of our warriors; their arrows rested in their quivers; their bowstrings
no longer sounded; the tired chieftains leaned on their
war-clubs, and gazed at the terrible stranger, whom they dared
not approach. Give an ear to me, king: 't was then I held out
the hand of peace to him, and he became my brother; he forgot
his arms, for he trusted to his brother: he was discoursing wonders
to his friend, when our chiefs rushed upon him, and bore him
away. But oh! my father, he must not die; for he is not a war<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[Pg 594]</a></span>

never did my tongue raise the war cry, and the foe appeared not.
Be warned then to beware the white man. He has fixed his
serpent eye upon you, and, like the charmed bird, you flutter
each moment nearer to the jaw of death.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Powhatan.</span> How, Grimosco?</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Grimosco.</span> Do you want proof of the white man's hatred to
the red? Follow him along the bay; count the kings he has
conquered, and the nations that his sword has made extinct.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Powhatan.</span> Like a warrior he subdued them, for the chain
of friendship bound them not to each other. The white man is
brave as Aresqui; and can the brave be treacherous?</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Grimosco.</span> Like the red feathers of the flamingo is craft, the
brightest plume that graces the warrior's brow. Are not your
people brave? Yet does the friendly tree shield them while the
hatchet is thrown. Who doubts the courage of Powhatan? Yet
has the eye of darkness seen Powhatan steal to the surprise of
the foe.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Powhatan.</span> Ha! priest, thy words are true. I will be satisfied.
Even now I received a swift messenger from my son:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[Pg 615]</a></span>
to-day he will conduct the English to my banquet. I will demand
of him if he be the friend of Powhatan.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Grimosco.</span> Yes; but demand it of him as thou drawest thy
reeking hatchet from his cleft head. [<i><span class="smcap">King</span> starts.</i>] The
despoilers of our land must die!</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Powhatan.</span> What red man can give his eye-ball the glare of
defiance when the white chief is nigh? He who stood alone
amidst seven hundred foes, and, while he spurned their king to
the ground, dared them to shoot their arrows; who will say to
him, "White man, I am thine enemy?" No one. My chiefs
would be children before him.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Grimosco.</span> The valour of thy chiefs may slumber, but the
craft of thy priest shall watch. When the English sit at that
banquet from which they shall never rise; when their eyes
read nothing but friendship in thy looks, there shall hang a
hatchet over each victim head, which, at the silent signal of
Grimosco&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Powhatan.</span> Forbear, counsellor of death! Powhatan cannot
betray those who have vanquished his enemies; who are his
friends, his brothers.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Grimosco.</span> Impious! Can the enemies of your God be your
friends? Can the children of another parent be your brethren?
You are deaf to the counsellor: 'tis your priest now speaks.
I have heard the angry voice of the Spirit you have offended;
offended by your mercy to his enemies. Dreadful was his voice;
fearful were his words. Avert his wrath, or thou art condemned;
and the white men are the ministers of his vengeance.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Powhatan.</span> Priest!</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Grimosco.</span> From the face of the waters will he send them,
in mighty tribes, and our shores will scarce give space for their
footsteps. Powhatan will fly before them; his beloved child, his
wives, all that is dear to him, he will leave behind. Powhatan
will fly; but whither? which of his tributary kings will shelter
him? Not one. Already they cry, "Powhatan is ruled by the
white; we will no longer be the slaves of a slave!"</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Powhatan.</span> Ha!</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Grimosco.</span> Despoiled of his crown, Powhatan will be hunted
from the land of his ancestors. To strange woods will the fugitive
be pursued by the Spirit whom he has angered&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Powhatan.</span> Oh, dreadful!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[Pg 616]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Grimosco.</span> And at last, when the angel of death obeys his
call of anguish, whither will go his condemned soul? Not to the
fair forests, where his brave fathers are. Oh! never will Powhatan
clasp the dear ones who have gone before him. His exiled, solitary
spirit will forever houl on the barren heath where the wings
of darkness rest. No ray of hope shall visit him; eternal will be
his night of despair.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Powhatan.</span> Forbear, forbear! O priest, teach me to avert
the dreadful doom.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Grimosco.</span> Let the white men be slaughtered.</p>
